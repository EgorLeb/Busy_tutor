### What about:  Our project aims to create a website for quick scheduling between tutor and student. The main goal of the project is to make it easier for the tutor and other workers by providing them with a convenient tool to optimize the schedule. Our advantage is that when a student signs up for a class - it automatically appears in the tutor's Google calendar, which is much more convenient than keeping different calendars for personal life and work.

### Key features of the project:

- The site gives the tutor the ability to set free time slots for the week that will be available for students to sign up.
- Students can view the tutor's free time slots and submit class requests to the free slots.
- The site allows the tutor to view, edit, and manage their schedule, as well as accept or reject lesson requests from students.
- Alerts and reminders to a linked email are provided for both parties - tutor and student - to keep communication timely and reliable.
